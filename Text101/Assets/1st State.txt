Aghhhh.... Your eyes flicker as a bright light shines down into them. Squinting you look around and wonder, where am I?
The unfamilar envioronment around you contains many colorful plants and trees that you have never seen before. You get up
to study your surroundings and have a decision to make.

What will you do?
1. Leave the area to search for clues on how you got here.
2. Stay where you are and wait.

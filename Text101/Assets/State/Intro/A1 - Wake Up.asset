  storyText: "Ughhhh.... Your eyes flicker as a bright light shines down into them.
    Squinting you look around and wonder, where am I?\r\n\r\nThe unfamiliar environment
    around you contains many colorful plants and trees that you have never seen before.
    You get up to study your surroundings and seem to see pillar of smoke rising
    in the distance. You have a decision to make.\r\n\r\nWhat will you do?\r\n\r\n1.
    Leave the area to search for clues on how you got here.\r\n\r2. Stay where you
    are and wait for help."

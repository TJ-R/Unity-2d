  storyText: 'As you head towards the smoke you spot a few building in distance surrounded
    by a wall. Starving and thirsty you approach the outskirts with hope to find
    food. Suddenly you stop and see a couple of what appears to be hunters with spears
    and bows speaking a language that you have never heard before. Should you try
    to sneak in and steal some supplies or attempt to communicate with them hoping
    they can give you some supplies?

    

    1. Sneak and look for supplies

    2.
    Attempt to communicate'

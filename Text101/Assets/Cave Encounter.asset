  storyText: 'After trekking through the forest for a couple of days you come across
    a cave the entrance is dark giving you no inclination as to what could lie inside.
    The cave seems to be on a direct path towards the smoke. Currently, you are low
    on supplies and are struggling to find food that you found so easily earlier.
    You have two choices a detour that may take a few days which you will run out
    of food on if more is not found or enter the cave with the hope that you will
    exit quickly.

    

    1. Enter the cave...

    2. Take a detour...'
